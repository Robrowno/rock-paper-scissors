# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Scope, Goals and Description
Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors game! 

This is a player vs computer game where, following the rules of the game, the user and computer can score points up to 10, before one or the other wins that round. 

This game is designed to be played by someone who wants to play a game but doesn't have the time to play something complex. Perhaps on a mobile phone when travelling on the subway/underground. It is also ideal for a younger audience This game is at a simple enough complexity that is can be played and enjoyed by anyone, as it is everyday by children everywhere. The game has many variations to it across the globe, swapping out the names of rock, paper and scissors for other words, or adding complexity by introducing other variables (Such as Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!). For my game, I've opted to keep the traditional 3 variable rock, paper and scissors!

The goal of this website, beyond testing my Javascript abilities, is to make a well-tested and fully functioning basic game that combines functionality with clean design and colours.

## Wireframe
I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes for this project. I took a mobile/tablet-first approach with this project, and as such, my wireframes reflect that. 

I first went about creating a wireframe for how I wanted my starting page to look, and when I was happy, I moved on to the game page sections for tablet and mobil respectively.

## UX Description

For this game, bright and bold colours were a must. However, I wanted to make sure that they kept the player's focus and didn't distract from the objective of the game!
I featured the follwing:

Colours:
- A radial gradient background featuring #fdbb2d, orange and aquamarine.
- Start-Game and Reset buttons in Green.
- All content boxes in Lightgreen.
- User and Computer score labels in Lightskyblue
- Score and Timer in #fff 
- All fonts and borders in Black.
